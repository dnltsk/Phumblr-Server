## Phumblr - Photo Stumbler

Times have changed - today people discover new cities and places in an explorative way  instead of reading travel guides. However they don’t want to miss all the special and unique locations. Phumblr notifies you kindly when you’re stumbling across a high frequent photographed spot. By showing you a handful of the most popular photographies and relevant Wikipedia headlines on the SmartWatch you can decide by your own if you want to take a closer look or not..
